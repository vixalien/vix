    <p>Specifications about the Vix Design System.</p>
    <p>Vix Design is an independent way in which you can design your apps or websites, focusing on user interface. Vix Design allows you to control how much your apps integrate with the Vix Design System.</p>
    <h2>Knowledge</h2>
    <p>Unlike other design systems, Vix doesn't have a single way of look. It only give advice to how your websites or apps look like. It is up to you to decide!</p>
    <h2>Levels</h2>
    <p>Vix Design <i>does</i> have reusable components, but it is up to you to choose how much you include it. There are currently three levels.</p>
    <p>Levels are made up of smaller siblings of levels. For example, Medium Levels are made up of many Low levels combined.</p>
    <h3>Low level</h3>
    <p>This level is for basic looks. It provide basic infrastructure for other levels</p>
